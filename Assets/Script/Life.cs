    //Evolution function |ADD| The base for infuencing future behavior?

    //Regulation function |B| In Biology, Even the smallest organisms are complex and require multiple regulatory mechanisms to coordinate internal functions, respond to stimuli, and cope with environmental stresses.

        //Order can include highly organized structures such as cells, tissues, organs, and organ systems.
        //Interaction with the environment is shown by response to stimuli.
        //The ability to reproduce, grow and develop are defining features of life.
        //The concepts of biological regulation and maintenance of homeostasis are key to survival and define major properties of life.
        //Organisms use energy to maintain their metabolic processes.
        //Populations of organisms evolve to produce individuals that are adapted to their specific environment.
